This project was created to restore the game's functionality on modern mobile devices (Android 10+, currently ARMv7 only).
Russian language support has been implemented (via a workaround, as I didn't see much point in adding new logic to the game code). translation by https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=589781&st=20#entry53720087

All in-game purchases have been made free.
A Java debugger has been added to handle potential game crashes.
This is a non-commercial project created by an enthusiast.

Why did you restore this game?
It is a simple game that faced difficulties with 64-bit processor support and Java updates on Android. Unfortunately, the game was built on a custom engine and the developer didn't plan to update it due to compatibility and popularity issues; it was more profitable for them to abandon the project.
Initially, I just wanted to play it on my own device but encountered launch issues.
